I do not mind taking orders and being told what to do.#
I must admit I try to see what others think before I take a stand.#
I day dream very little.#
I have a good appetite.#
If the pay was right, I would like to travel with a circus or carnival.#
When I get bored I like to stir up some excitement.#
It is hard for me to just still today and relax.#
Sometimes I feel that I'm about to go to pieces.#
I sometimes feel that I am a burden to others.#
I must admit that I am a high-strung person.#
