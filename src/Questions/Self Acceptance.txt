My daily life is full of things that keep me interested.#
I would like to wear expensive clothes.#
Once in a while I laugh at a dirty joke.#
Sometimes I rather enjoy going against the rules and doing things I'm not supposed to do.#
I have a natural talent for influencing people.#
I doubt whether I would make a good leader.#
When in a group of people, I have trouble thinking of right things to talk about.#
I'm certainly lacking in self confidence.#
When I meet a stranger, I often think that he or she is better than I am.#
It is hard for me to act natural when I'm with new people.#
