I take a rather serious attitude towards ethical and moral issues.#
If given the chance, I would make a good leader of people.#
People see naturally to turn to me when decisions have to be made.#
I enjoy planning things and deciding what each person should do.#
I have had very peculiar and strange experiences.#
I get pretty discouraged sometimes.#
I certainly feel useless at times.#
I often act on the spur of the moment without stopping to think.#
My way of doing things is apt to be misunderstood by others.#
It seems that people used to have more fun than they now.
