I do not dread seeing a doctor about a sickness or injury.#
I hardly ever get excited or trilled.#
Several times a week I feel as if something dreadful is about to happen.#
Clever, sarcastic people make me feel very uncomfortable.#
The thought of being in an automobile accident is very frightening to me.#
I cannot keep my mind on one thing.#
I fall in and out of love rather easily.#
I can remember playing sick to get out of something.#
I am a very ticklish person.#
It is pretty easy for people to win arguments with me.#
