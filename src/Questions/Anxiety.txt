I get very tensed and anxious when I think other people are disapproving me.#
With things going as they are, its pretty hard to keep hope of amounting to something.#
I am so touchy on some subjects that I can't talk about them.#
I refuse to play some games because I am not good at them.#
I almost never go to sleep.#
I am made nervous by certain animals.#
I doubt if anyone is really happy.#
Life usually hands me a pretty raw deal.#
I usually try to do what is expected of me to avoid criticism.#
Most people are secretly pleased when someone else gets into trouble.
