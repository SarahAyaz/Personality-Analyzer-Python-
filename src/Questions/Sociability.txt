I enjoy social gathering just to be with people.#
A person needs to "Show off" a little now.#
I like to be the center of attention.#
I have no dread of going into a room by myself where other people have already gathered and are talking.#
I like parties and socials.#
I usually feel nervous and ill at ease at a formal dance on party.#
When in a group of people, I have trouble thinking of the right things to talk about.#
I am likely not to speak to people until they speak to me.#
I feel nervous if I have to meet a lot of people.#
I am quite often not in a gossip and talk of the group I belong to.#
