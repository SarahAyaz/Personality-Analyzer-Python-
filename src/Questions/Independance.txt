When I work on a committee I like to take charge of things.#
I would be willing to describe myself as a pretty "STRONG" personality.#
It is hard for me to sympathize with someone who is always doubting and unsure about things.#
I am known as a hard and steady worker.#
I had my own way as a child.#
I seem to do things that I regret more often than other people do.#
One of my aims in life is to accomplish something that would make my mother proud of me.#
Before I do something, I try to consider how my friends will react to it.#
I feel like giving up quickly when things go wrong.#
I get tired more easily than other people do.
