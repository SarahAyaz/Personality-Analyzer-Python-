I consider a matter from every standpoint before I make a decision.#
I keep out of trouble at all costs.#
I have very few quarrels with members of my family.#
I have never done anything dangerous for the thrill of it.#
I think I would like to belong to a motorcycle club.#
Sometimes I feel like smashing things.#
I must admit I often try to get my own way regardless of what others may want.#
I do not always tell the truth.#
Sometimes I feel as if I must injure either myself or someone else.#
I am often bothered by useless thoughts which keep running through my mind.#
