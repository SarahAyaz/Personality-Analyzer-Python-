I think I would like the work of a dress designer.#
I get excited very easily.#
I would like to be a nurse.#
If I were a reporter, I would like very much to report news of the theater.#
I must admit I feel sort of scared when I move to strange place.#
I think I would like the work of a building contractor.#
I must admit that I enjoy playing practical jokes on people.#
I like to boast about my achievements every now and then.#
I think I would like the work of a garage mechanic.#
I like to be with people who play jokes on each other.
