It is always a good thing to be frank.#
Most of the arguments or quarrels I get into are over matters of principle.#
I set a high standard for myself, and I feel others should do the same.#
I think I am strict about right and wrong than most people.#
I have had more than my share of things to worry about.#
I often wish people would be more definite about things.#
I find that a well-ordered node of life with regular hours is congenial to my temperament.#
I like to have a place for anything and everything in its place.#
It bothers me when something unexpected interrupts my daily routine.#
I don't like things to be uncertain and unpredictable.
