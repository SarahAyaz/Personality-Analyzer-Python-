Most of the time I feel happy.#
Sometimes I cross the street just to avoid meeting someone.#
I usually feel that life is worth while.#
I get all the sympathy I should.#
I am inclineD to take things hard.#
At times I have a strong urge to do something harmful or shocking.#
I don't seem to care what happens to me.#
I have nightmares every few night.#
Some of my family have habits that bother and annoy me very much.#
No one seems to understand me.#
