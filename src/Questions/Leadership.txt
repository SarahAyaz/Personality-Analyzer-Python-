The members of my family were always very close to each other.#
I like to talk before groups of people.#
I like to plan out my activities in advance.#
When the community makes a decision, it is up to a person to help carry it out even if he or she had been against it.#
I would rather have people dislike me than look down on me.#
In a group of people I usually take the responsibility to getting people introduce.#
I like to give orders and get things moving.#
I find it hard to keep my mind on a task or job.#
I get very nervous if I think that someone is watching me.#
I often feel as if the world was just passing me by.
