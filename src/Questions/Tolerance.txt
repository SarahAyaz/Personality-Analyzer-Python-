I like poetry.#
There are times when I act like a coward.#
I do not like to see people carelessly dressed.#
I don't blame people for trying to grab all they can get in this world.#
People should adapt their idea and behaviour in the group that happens to be with them at that time.#
Most people are honest cheifly through fear of being caught.#
The future is too uncertain for a person to make serious plans.#
I want to be an important person in the community.#
As a child I was suspended from school one or more times for disciplinary reasons.#
People often talk about me behind my back.#
